# Algorithms in the cosmodrome

Baikonur is a city in Kazakhstan, under russian administration, where it is located the largest space facility in the world. Both Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite, and Vostok 1, the first human spaceflight, were launched from the Baikonur Cosmododrome.

Baikonur could also be see as a closed city open to the universe. It is a closed city because a special authorization is required to visit or leave the city located in the Kazakh steep, it is open to the universe because its space facilities are still in use nowadays for launches to the International Space Station.

In this course we will have a look at a collection of algorithms that deal with space subdivision, world creation, travel and exploration, making our room in our personal space station.
